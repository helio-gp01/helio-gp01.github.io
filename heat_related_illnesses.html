<p><i>Occurs once a person experiences an over exposure to heat related conditions usually after working or playing in the heat, perspiring heavily or being dehydrated.</i><br><br>From disinfecting wounds to taping an ankle properly, basic first aid is essential to know. Basic first aid is used when you have a minor cut, scrape, burn, or sprain that you wouldn't visit a doctor for since most minor injuries can be patched up at home. One of the most common injury in Florida would be dehydration. These symptoms include but aren't restricted to: increased thirst, dry mouth, being tired or sleepy, decreased urine output, headache, dizziness, urine is low in volume or more yellowish than normal. This can eventually lead to seizure, fainting, or shock if untreated.
